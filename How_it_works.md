## How it works

#### First, a tiny bit of terminology...

- A single action that can be performed by Kragle is called a *Block*
- A set of *Blocks* that have been glued together is called a *Stack*
- A *Job* indicates when or how often a *Stack* is to be run. (A *Stack* can have one or more, or zero, *Jobs* associated with it)

### Creating your Stacks

When creating a Stack, you first choose a Block to start with from the list of available pre-defined and community-provided Blocks.

Each Block will usually have certain information that you need to fill out in order to configure it. For example, if you
select the *"New Tweet matching Hashtag..."* Block, you will need to fill in the #hashtag you want to search for.

Once you have your first Block setup, you select another Block to stack onto the end of the first, and configure it the same way.

You then proceed with adding more blocks to the stack, or stop there if you are finished.

### Creating Jobs - Setting your Stacks to run

Once you have a Stack created, you need to turn it on by creating a Job for it.

Creating a Job for a stack simply requires choosing from the available list of predefined schedules (every 5 mins, etc), or
filling in the details of when you want it to run (Tuesdays at 8pm, etc).

After filling in the details for the Job, you can set it to enabled or disabled (on/off).

As soon as a Stack has an enabled Job associated with it, it will be active and will start running according to the specified schedule.

**That's it!!!**
