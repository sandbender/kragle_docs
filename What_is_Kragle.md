## What is Kragle?

Kragle is a service that lets you automate actions between sites, services and apps.

It is the "glue" which you use to stack these actions together, and it runs the resulting
stacks of actions for you on a recurring schedule, 24/7/365.

Kragle requires no programming knowledge at all - you can use our website to setup all
your automatic app Kung-Fu and be up and running in minutes.

### Okay that sounds pretty sweet, but... give me some examples?

In Kragle a set of actions that you've glued together and setup to work automatically
is called a Stack. Here are some Stack examples..

- **Tweet** when you favourite a *Track* on **Soundcloud**
- Automatically copy **Pinterest** *pins* to an **Evernote** *notebook*
- Add an *event* to **Google Calendar** when you clip a *recipe* on **Epicurious**
- Add items to an *rss feed* when there are new results for a *search* on **ThePirateBay**
- Send a *message* to a **HipChat** room when a new *commit* happens on your **GitHub** account

#### Stacks are **not** limited to just two actions

- use Kragle to post a *message* to **LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter** all at the same time
- copy an **Epicurious** *recipe* to an **Evernote** *notebook* when you favourite it, and  
  then create a **Google Calendar** *event* for dinner tonight with a *link* to the recipe

#### Simple Filtering/Processing

- Watch for new *front-page items* on the HackerNews **rss feed**, **select** only items matching  
  a *pattern*, and then send those *items* to your **Pocket** queue.
- Search **recent tweets** for a *hashtag*, **filter** any that don't ALSO have another *hashtag*,  
  and **retweet** the results **at a specific time**.

#### Schedules (How often do my stacks run?)

- Stacks on a recurring basis by default (every 5 or 15 minutes, etc)
- Stacks can be setup to run at a certain time instead of every X minutes
- Stacks can also be setup to run only one, at a specific time on a certain day
- Stacks can be configured to **not** run automatically, but instead can be
  be run directly by you OR as a url that only runs when accessed
