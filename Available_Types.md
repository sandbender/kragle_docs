## Available Types

This is a list of publicly available Types currently available for use when creating custom Blocks (ie: for use when specifying input and output Types.

We will attempt to keep this up to date, but the main goal is to provide documentation for **some** Types, so that users of
this documentation can get a 'feel' for how they work/what they look like/how they're created/etc.

You can always use the site to lookup Types, or pull their details via the public API.

The following list is broken up according to site/service/app which the Type in question is related to, as most Types will be site-specific (ie: a Type for a Tweet would be Twitter-specific, a Pin would be Pinterest-specific, etc).

The first 'Misc' category below collects some well-known Types which are **not** site-specific.
